# Survival Web Game

## Devlog #1 
> Day 1

Working socket.io based server with multiple players on one board (10x10 coordinates), database (mongodb) to store players objects with positions + ability to connect as one of many players (characters) and move using buttons and WSAD. Moving one character triggers websocket based comunication to sync all players movement. Basic client build in vue 3 with socket.io client library.
